Hi, this portion of the repository contains the python codes for the automation which has been picked up from https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ (chapter - 11 onwards).

The repository contains the python codes for learning the modules and the projects that were related to each topic on the website mentioned above.

In addition, the python snippets also contains some extra codes that were typed out for better understanding of the topic and see th eoutputs we were getting in multiple stages of the code running.

The major part of some of the snippets of code have been commented out, solely for the purpose of doing the task below them. Feel free to uncomment the lines of code and run it.
