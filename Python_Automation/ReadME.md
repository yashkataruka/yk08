Hi, this portion of the repository contains the python codes for the automation which has been picked up from https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ (chapter - 11 onwards).

The repository contains the python codes for learning the modules and the projects that were related to each topic on the website mentioned above. The details of each and every code can be found on https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ .

Apart from that, the repositry also contains a code for the game tic-tac-toe and a code for automted instagram login under the folder "Internet" which were not given on the website.

The folder of IRCTC contains a GUI based code for booking of tatkal and general tickets based on the module 'pyautogui'. This particular code runs in the dynamics of the pixel value and the position of the buttons on the IRCTC website. Henceforth, this code is not made for practical use but solely made for the purpose of learning the module named above.

In addition, the python snippets also contains some extra codes that were typed out for better understanding of the topic and see the outputs we were getting in multiple stages of the code running.

The major part of some of the snippets of code have been commented out, only for the purpose of doing the task below them. Feel free to uncomment the lines of code and run it. 

In multiple sub-folders of this repository, along with the python codes, it also contains the input data and the output data related with the topic which is the name of that sub-folder.
